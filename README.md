# EnvelopeBuddy 

EnvelopeBuddy is a Discord bot designed to help a couple track shared and individual expenses using an envelope-style budgeting system. The bot utilizes slash commands, features detailed reporting, and includes mechanisms for quick expense logging. It focuses on maintaining current envelope balances and is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi.

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. Envelopes
* **Types:** Envelopes can be for short-term expenses (resetting monthly) or longer-term savings/spending (carrying over a balance).
* **Categories:** Each envelope is assigned a category, typically "necessary" (e.g., groceries) or "quality\_of\_life" (e.g., eating out), for classification and potential future reporting.
* **Ownership:** Envelopes can be **shared** between the couple or **individual**.
    * Individual envelope "types" (e.g., "Hobby") are instantiated for *both* users, each with their own balance and allocation.
* **Attributes:** Each envelope has a monthly `allocation` amount and a `current_balance`.
* **Rollover:** A boolean flag indicates if the remaining balance should roll over to the next month or if the envelope should reset to its allocation.
* **Soft Delete & Re-enable:** Envelopes can be soft-deleted (marked inactive). Attempting to create an envelope with the same name (and user context for individual envelopes) as a soft-deleted one will re-enable it, optionally updating its attributes. The `is_individual` status of an envelope is fixed upon its initial creation and cannot be changed by re-enabling.

### 1.2. Transactions
* Represent financial activities (spending, adding funds, product usage).
* Each transaction is linked to an envelope and records the amount, description, user who initiated it, timestamp, and type (e.g., "spend", "deposit").

### 1.3. Products
* Fixed-price items that map to a specific pre-defined envelope instance.
* Users can define products with a name, unit price (calculated from total price and optional quantity at creation/update), and linked envelope.
* Using a product deducts its price (multiplied by quantity) from the correct user's instance of the linked envelope type (if individual) or the shared envelope.

### 1.4. Shortcuts
* *(Implementation currently deferred. To be revisited if desired.)*
* Original Concept: Command templates with parameters for variable-price items, allowing users to quickly execute pre-filled commands (primarily for spending) by providing a variable amount and an optional note.

### 1.5. Splurge Mechanism (Future Plan)
* Allows a single expense to be split between a primary target envelope and a dedicated "Splurge" envelope.
* The "Splurge" envelope is an individual type (one instance per user, or a shared couple's fund). Its funding is handled manually (e.g., via `/addfunds` or future custom allocation cycles), not via a standard monthly allocation.
* Users will specify the total expense and the amount to be covered by the "Splurge" envelope; the remainder comes from the primary envelope.
* Command: Likely `/spend <primary_envelope> <total_amount> <description> --splurge <amount_for_splurge>` (or a dedicated subcommand).
* Transaction Recording: Ideally a single logical transaction with multiple legs or clearly linked transactions.
* Reporting/Feedback: Mini-report after a splurge spend will show the impact on *both* affected envelopes.
* **Open Questions:** Splurge envelope naming/setup? Individual vs. shared nature of the "Splurge" fund itself? Overdraft handling for either leg?

### 1.6. Recurring Subscriptions (Future Plan)
* Automated logging of recurring expenses (and potentially income).
* Users will define subscriptions (name, amount, envelope, frequency, day of processing).
* A scheduling mechanism (e.g., daily check) within the bot will process due subscriptions.
* If an envelope has insufficient funds, the transaction will still be logged (overdraft), and users will be pinged/notified.
* Successful processing will also trigger a notification.
* Management commands (`/subscription add/list/delete/edit`) will be needed.
* **Open Questions:** Precise handling for "day 31" in short months? How to differentiate recurring income vs. expenses if using a similar system (e.g., via transaction type or signed amounts in definition)?

### 1.7. Savings Goals (Future Plan)
* Users can define a target amount for a specific (likely rollover) envelope.
* Commands: `/goal set <envelope_name> <goal_name> <target_amount> [target_date]`, `/goal remove <goal_name>`, `/goal list`.
* The bot can report progress and potentially notify (e.g., via daily mechanism) when a goal is met.

## 3. Configuration

* **`.env` file:**
    * `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The bot's Discord token.
    * `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (e.g., `data/envelope_buddy.sqlite`).
    * `COUPLE_USER_ID_1`: Discord User ID of the first user.
    * `COUPLE_USER_ID_2`: Discord User ID of the second user.
    * `USER_NICKNAME_1`: Nickname for User 1.
    * `USER_NICKNAME_2`: Nickname for User 2.
    * `RUST_LOG`: Logging configuration (e.g., `envelope_buddy=debug,info`).
    * `DEV_GUILD_ID` (Optional): For fast registration of slash commands to a specific test server.
    * `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` (Future): Channel ID for persistent logging.
* **`config.toml` file:**
    * Defines the initial set of envelopes (name, category, allocation, is\_individual, rollover). Seeded into the database.

## 4. Command System (Poise Framework with Slash Commands)

Organized into modules (`general`, `envelope`, `transaction`, `product`, `utils`).

### 4.1. Implemented Commands

* **General:**
    * `/ping`: Replies "Pong!"
* **Envelope Management (Parent: `/envelope` - or individual commands if not grouped yet)**
    * `/report`: Displays a full embed report of active envelopes: balance, allocation, actual spent, expected pace, status indicator (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âšª).
    * `/create_envelope name:<name> [category:<cat>] [allocation:<amt>] [is_individual:<bool>] [rollover:<bool>]`: Creates/re-enables an envelope. Optional parameters preserve old values on re-enable; balance resets to effective allocation. For new individual types, creates instances for both configured users.
    * `/delete_envelope name:<name>`: Soft-deletes an envelope.
    * `/update`: (Monthly processing) Handles rollovers/resets, prunes old transactions, updates `system_state`.
* **Transaction Posting:**
    * `/spend envelope_name:<env> amount:<amt> [description:<desc>]`: Records a spend. Autocompletes envelope names. Replies with a mini-report embed.
    * `/addfunds envelope_name:<env> amount:<amt> [description:<desc>]`: Adds funds. Records a "deposit" transaction. Autocompletes envelope names. Replies with a mini-report embed.
* **Product Management (Parent: `/product`, Subcommands: `add`, `list`, `update`, `consume`)**
    * `/product add name:<name> total_price:<price> envelope:<env_name> [quantity:<num>] [description:<text>]`: Adds a new product, unit price calculated. `envelope_name` uses autocomplete.
    * `/product list`: Lists all defined products and their details in an embed.
    * `/product update name:<name> total_price:<price> [quantity:<num>]`: Updates product's unit price. `name` uses autocomplete.
    * `/product consume name:<name> [quantity:<num>]`: Records expense using a product. Debits contextual user/shared envelope. `name` uses autocomplete. Replies with mini-report.

### 4.2. Planned Future Commands & Features (Summary)

* **Splurge Spending:** `/spend ... --splurge ...` or `/splurgespend ...` (or `/product splurge ...` if related to a product).
* **Undo Command:** `/undo` (reverts last financial transaction for the couple).
* **Transaction History (Enhanced):** `/history envelope_name:<env> [month:<num>] [year:<num>]`.
* **Transaction Editing:** (Re-evaluate) Potentially `/edit_transaction <id> ...`
* **Recurring Subscriptions/Income:** `/subscription add/list/delete/edit`, `/recurring_income add/...`. Automatic daily processing.
* **Savings Goals:** `/goal set/list/remove`. Automatic check and notification.
* **Fund Transfers:** `/transfer <amount> from:<env> to:<env>`.
* **(Deferred) Shortcuts:** `/shortcut add/list/delete`, `/useshortcut`.

## 5. Message Processing and UX

* **Slash Commands:** Primary interaction.
* **Autocomplete:** For envelope names, product names. Case-insensitive.
* **Mini-Reports:** Embeds showing status of affected envelope after `/spend`, `/addfunds`, `/product consume`.
* **Dual Output (Future):**
    * Database-modifying commands: Ephemeral reply to issuer, persistent log to `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`.
    * Daily full `/report` to `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` via scheduler.
